# 🎯 Popularity Scoring Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide shows you how to add intelligent popularity scoring to your documentation search MCP server, enabling data-driven library recommendations for developers.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

### Step 1: Enhance Configuration Structure

Update your `config.json` to include popularity data:

```json
{
    "cache": {
        "enabled": true,
        "ttl_hours": 24,
        "max_entries": 1000
    },
    "docs_urls": {
        "fastapi": {
            "url": "https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/",
            "category": "web-framework",
            "popularity": {
                "overall_score": 88,
                "github_stars": "70000+",
                "learning_curve": "easy",
                "job_market": "growing",
                "maturity": "stable",
                "trending": "hot"
            },
            "tags": ["python", "api", "async", "modern"]
        }
        // ... more libraries
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Add New MCP Tools

Add these tools to your `main.py`:

```python
@mcp.tool()
async def recommend_libraries(use_case: str, experience_level: str = "intermediate"):
    """Recommend libraries based on use case and developer experience level"""
    config = load_config()
    # Implementation here...

@mcp.tool()
async def compare_libraries(library_names: List[str]):
    """Compare multiple libraries across popularity metrics"""
    # Implementation here...

@mcp.tool()
async def get_trending_libraries(category: str = "all"):
    """Get trending libraries in a specific category"""
    # Implementation here...
```

## 📊 Popularity Metrics Explained

### Core Metrics

| Metric | Weight | Description | Data Source |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Overall Score** | 100% | Composite score (0-100) | Calculated |
| **GitHub Stars** | 40% | Community popularity | GitHub API |
| **Job Market** | 25% | Career opportunities | Curated/Survey data |
| **Learning Curve** | 20% | Ease of adoption | Expert assessment |
| **Trending Status** | 10% | Growth trajectory | GitHub activity |
| **Maturity** | 5% | Stability/reliability | Age + activity |

### Scoring Categories

**Overall Score Ranges:**
- 90-100: **Market Leaders** (Python, React, AWS)
- 80-89: **Strong Contenders** (FastAPI, Django)
- 70-79: **Solid Choices** (Flask, Express)
- 60-69: **Niche/Specialized** (Streamlit, Ansible)
- <60: **Emerging/Experimental**

**Learning Curve:**
- **Easy**: 1-2 weeks to productivity (FastAPI, Streamlit)
- **Moderate**: 1-2 months to proficiency (React, Python)
- **Steep**: 3-6 months to mastery (Django, Kubernetes)

**Job Market:**
- **Excellent**: 1000+ job postings/month (React, Python, AWS)
- **Hot**: 500+ job postings/month (FastAPI, Node.js)
- **Growing**: 100+ job postings/month (LangChain, Docker)
- **Stable**: Steady demand (Flask, Express)

## 🛠 Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Static Curated (Recommended to Start)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Quick implementation (1-2 hours)
- ✅ Reliable data
- ✅ No API dependencies
- ✅ Full editorial control

**Setup:**
1. Create enhanced config with popularity data
2. Add recommendation tools to MCP server
3. Test with Cursor integration

### Approach 2: Dynamic API-based

**Pros:**
- ✅ Real-time data
- ✅ Automatic updates
- ✅ Objective metrics

**Setup:**
1. Get API tokens (GitHub, NPM)
2. Implement API fetching logic
3. Add periodic update schedule
4. Handle rate limiting and errors

### Approach 3: Hybrid (Production Ready)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Best of both worlds
- ✅ Reliable fallbacks
- ✅ Fresh data when available

**Implementation:**
1. Start with static scores
2. Add API fetching for popular libraries
3. Cache API results with TTL
4. Fallback to static on API failures

## 🎯 Use Cases and Examples

### For Beginners

**Query**: *"I'm new to web development. What should I learn?"*

**MCP Response**:
```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "library": "fastapi",
      "score": 93,
      "reasoning": "Score: 93/100, Learning: easy, Market: growing",
      "why": "Easy to learn, growing job market, modern async features"
    },
    {
      "library": "react", 
      "score": 92,
      "reasoning": "Score: 92/100, Learning: moderate, Market: excellent",
