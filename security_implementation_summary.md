export SNYK_ORG_ID="your-snyk-organization-id"

# Existing Variables  
export SERPER_API_KEY="your-serper-api-key"
```

### Snyk Account Setup
1. **Sign up**: Create account at [snyk.io](https://snyk.io)
2. **Get API Token**: Account Settings ‚Üí API Tokens ‚Üí Generate
3. **Find Organization ID**: Organization Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Organization ID
4. **Set Permissions**: Ensure API token has scan and monitor permissions

## Usage Examples

### üîç Quick Library Security Check
```bash
# Via AI Assistant with MCP integration
"Can you scan the security of FastAPI library using Snyk?"
# Calls: snyk_scan_library("fastapi", "latest", "pypi")
```

### üìã Project Security Audit
```bash
# Via AI Assistant
"Please run a comprehensive security audit of my current project"
# Calls: snyk_scan_project(".")
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è License Compliance Review
```bash
# Via AI Assistant
"Check if my project dependencies comply with our strict license policy"
# Calls: snyk_license_check(".", "strict")
```

### üîÑ Continuous Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Via AI Assistant
"Set up continuous security monitoring for this project"
# Calls: snyk_monitor_project(".")
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### Enhanced Security Workflow
1. **Library Research**: Use existing `get_docs()` for documentation
2. **Security Assessment**: Use new `snyk_scan_library()` for security analysis
3. **Comparison**: Use existing `compare_library_security()` for alternatives
4. **Project Analysis**: Use new `snyk_scan_project()` for full audit
5. **Monitoring**: Use new `snyk_monitor_project()` for ongoing security

### Complementary Tools
- **Existing OSV Scanner**: Provides free, open-source vulnerability data
- **New Snyk Scanner**: Adds premium vulnerability intelligence and remediation
- **License Analysis**: Both tools provide license information
- **Project Generation**: Existing tools create secure project templates
