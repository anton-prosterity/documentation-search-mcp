# 🧪 Testing Your Enhanced MCP Server with Cursor

## ✅ Pre-Testing Checklist

### **1. Verify MCP Server Works**
```bash
# Test server starts without errors
python main.py
# Should wait for input (press Ctrl+C to exit)
```

### **2. Check Environment**
```bash
# Verify Python path
which python
# Should show: /Users/antonmishel/workspace/documentation/.venv/bin/python

# Verify API key is set
echo $SERPER_API_KEY
# Should show your API key
```

## 🔧 Cursor Integration Setup

### **Step 1: Add MCP Configuration**

1. **Open Cursor Settings** (`Cmd + ,`)
2. **Navigate to** "Features" → "Model Context Protocol"
3. **Add this configuration:**

```json
{
  "name": "documentation-search-enhanced",
  "command": "/Users/antonmishel/workspace/documentation/.venv/bin/python",
  "args": ["/Users/antonmishel/workspace/documentation/main.py"],
  "env": {
    "SERPER_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

4. **Save and restart Cursor**

### **Step 2: Verify MCP Server Connection**

1. **Open Cursor**
2. **Start a new chat**
3. **Look for MCP indicator** (should show "documentation-search-enhanced" is connected)

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Basic Documentation Search**
**Query:** `Search Python documentation for async patterns`

**Expected Response:**
- Should use `get_docs` tool
- Return comprehensive Python async documentation
- Include multiple sources and examples

### **Test 2: Smart Library Recommendations**
**Query:** `What's the best Python web framework for a beginner?`

**Expected Response:**
- Should use `recommend_libraries` tool
- Provide personalized recommendations based on "beginner" experience
- Include scores, learning curves, and reasoning

### **Test 3: Library Comparison**
**Query:** `Compare FastAPI vs Django vs Flask for my project`

**Expected Response:**
- Should use `compare_libraries` tool
- Show side-by-side comparison with pros/cons
- Declare a winner with reasoning

### **Test 4: Trending Analysis**
**Query:** `Show me trending AI libraries with good job prospects`

**Expected Response:**
- Should use `get_trending_libraries` tool
- Filter for AI-related libraries
- Include job market insights

### **Test 5: Detailed Library Insights**
**Query:** `Give me detailed insights about React's market position`

**Expected Response:**
- Should use `get_library_insights` tool
- Provide market analysis, learning investment, job outlook
- Include recommendations and best use cases

### **Test 6: Auto-Suggestions**
**Query:** `What libraries start with "lang"?`

**Expected Response:**
- Should use `suggest_libraries` tool
- Return libraries like "langchain"

## ✅ Success Indicators

### **Visual Confirmation**
- [ ] MCP server shows as "Connected" in Cursor
- [ ] Tools are available in chat interface
- [ ] Responses include tool execution logs

### **Functional Confirmation**
- [ ] All 6 test scenarios work correctly
- [ ] Responses are intelligent and contextual
- [ ] Original documentation search still works
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (responses in 5-15 seconds)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: MCP Server Not Connected**
**Solutions:**
1. Check Python path is correct
2. Verify main.py exists and is executable
3. Ensure SERPER_API_KEY is set correctly
4. Restart Cursor completely
5. Check Cursor logs for error messages

### **Problem: Tools Not Working**
**Solutions:**
1. Verify API key is valid
2. Check internet connection
3. Test functions directly (as we did earlier)
4. Check for import errors in main.py

### **Problem: Slow Responses**
**Expected Behavior:**
- First request: 10-15 seconds (no cache)
- Subsequent requests: 2-5 seconds (cached)
- This is normal for documentation fetching

### **Problem: Error Messages**
**Common Issues:**
```
"Library not supported" → Check spelling in library name
"No results found" → Try different search terms
"Timeout error" → Check internet connection
```

## 🎯 Advanced Testing

### **Performance Test**
Ask multiple questions rapidly to test caching:
1. `Search React docs for hooks`
2. `Search React docs for state management` (should be faster)
3. `What are React's popularity metrics?`

### **Edge Cases**
- Ask about non-existent libraries
- Use very specific technical terms
- Request comparisons with 5+ libraries
- Test with different experience levels

## 🏆 Success Criteria

**Your MCP server is working perfectly if:**

✅ **All 6 test scenarios pass**  
✅ **Responses are intelligent and contextual**  
✅ **Tool execution is visible in Cursor**  
✅ **Performance is acceptable**  
✅ **Original features still work**  
✅ **Error handling is graceful**  

## 🎉 What Success Looks Like

When working correctly, you should be able to have conversations like:

> **You:** "I'm building a web API and I'm a beginner. What should I use?"
> 
> **Cursor with your MCP server:** "Based on your beginner experience level and web API use case, I recommend:
> 
> 1. **FastAPI** (Score: 96/100)
>    - Easy to learn (1-2 weeks)
>    - Growing job market
>    - Modern async features
>    - Perfect for beginners
> 
> 2. **Flask** (Score: 85/100)
>    - Easy to learn
>    - Lightweight and flexible
>    - Good for simple APIs
> 
> FastAPI is the winner because it combines ease of learning with modern features and growing market demand."

This level of intelligent, personalized guidance is what your enhanced MCP server provides! 🌟
