## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- UV package manager (recommended) or pip

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd documentation
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your SERPER_API_KEY
```

4. Get a Serper API key:
   - Visit [serper.dev](https://serper.dev)
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Copy your API key to the `.env` file

## Configuration

### Adding New Documentation Sources

To add support for new libraries, simply edit the `config.json` file:

```json
{
    "docs_urls": {
        "existing_library": "https://existing-docs.com",
        "new_library": "https://new-library-docs.com/api/"
    }
}
```

The server will automatically pick up changes to this file on restart. No code modifications required!

### Configuration Structure

The `config.json` file contains the following sections:

#### Cache Configuration
```json
{
    "cache": {
        "enabled": true,
        "ttl_hours": 24,
        "max_entries": 1000
    }
}
```

- **enabled**: Whether to enable in-memory caching
- **ttl_hours**: Time-to-live for cached content (default: 24 hours)
- **max_entries**: Maximum number of cached entries (default: 1000)

#### Documentation URLs
```json
{
    "docs_urls": {
        "library_name": "https://docs.example.com/"
    }
}
```

- **Key**: Library/framework name (used in search queries)
- **Value**: Base URL of the official documentation

## Usage

### Running the Server

```bash
python main.py
```

The server runs using the stdio transport protocol for MCP communication.

### Integration with AI Tools

#### Adding to Cursor

1. Open Cursor Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Navigate to "Features" → "Model Context Protocol"
3. Add a new MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "documentation-search",
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["/path/to/your/documentation/main.py"],
  "env": {
    "SERPER_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
  }
}
```

4. Replace `/path/to/your/documentation/main.py` with the absolute path to your main.py file
5. Save the configuration and restart Cursor

#### Adding to Claude Desktop

1. Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

2. Add the MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "documentation-search": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/documentation/main.py"],
      "env": {
        "SERPER_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. Replace `/path/to/your/documentation/main.py` with the absolute path to your main.py file
4. Restart Claude Desktop

#### Using Virtual Environments

If you're using a virtual environment (recommended), use the full path to the Python executable:

**For UV:**
```json
{
  "command": "/path/to/your/documentation/.venv/bin/python",
  "args": ["/path/to/your/documentation/main.py"]
}
```

**For Conda:**
```json
{
  "command": "/path/to/conda/envs/your-env/bin/python",
  "args": ["/path/to/your/documentation/main.py"]
}
```

### Available Tools

The server provides several MCP tools for documentation search and management:

#### 1. `get_docs` - Main Documentation Search
**Parameters:**
- `query` (string): Your search query (e.g., "authentication", "database connection")
- `library` (string): The library to search in (e.g., "fastapi", "react", "python")

**Example:**
```python
# Search for authentication info in FastAPI docs
get_docs(query="authentication middleware", library="fastapi")
```

#### 2. `suggest_libraries` - Library Auto-Completion
**Parameters:**
- `partial_name` (string): Partial library name for suggestions (e.g., "lang" → ["langchain"])

**Example:**
```python
# Get library suggestions
suggest_libraries(partial_name="fast")  # Returns ["fastapi"]
```

#### 3. `health_check` - Documentation Source Health
Monitor the availability and response times of documentation sources.

**Example:**
```python
health_check()  # Returns health status of documentation sites
```

#### 4. `get_cache_stats` - Cache Statistics
View current cache usage and performance metrics.

**Example:**
```python
get_cache_stats()  # Returns cache statistics and memory usage
```

#### 5. `clear_cache` - Cache Management
Force fresh fetches by clearing the documentation cache.

**Example:**
```python
clear_cache()  # Clears all cached documentation content
```

## Project Structure

```
documentation/
├── main.py           # Main MCP server implementation
├── config.json       # External configuration for documentation URLs
├── pyproject.toml    # Project dependencies and metadata
├── uv.lock          # Lock file for reproducible builds
├── .env             # Environment variables (API keys)
├── .gitignore       # Git ignore patterns
└── README.md        # This file
```

## How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: Takes your search query and target library
2. **Cache Check**: Checks in-memory cache for previously fetched content
3. **Site-specific Search**: Uses Serper API to search within the specific documentation site
4. **Parallel Fetching**: Concurrently fetches multiple documentation pages
5. **Content Extraction**: Parses and extracts clean text content using BeautifulSoup
6. **Intelligent Caching**: Stores results with TTL for faster future requests
7. **Error Recovery**: Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability

## Performance Features

- **Smart Caching**: Reduces API calls and improves response times by up to 10x for repeated queries
- **Concurrent Processing**: Fetches multiple documentation pages simultaneously
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff ensures reliable operation even with network issues
- **Content Optimization**: Removes navigation, scripts, and styling for cleaner text extraction
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cache cleanup prevents memory bloat

## API Dependencies

- **Serper API**: For web search functionality
- **FastMCP**: MCP server framework
- **httpx**: Async HTTP client
- **BeautifulSoup4**: HTML parsing and text extraction

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with:

```env
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here
```

## Contributing

To add support for new libraries:

1. Add the library and its documentation URL to `config.json`
2. Test that the documentation site returns useful content
3. Submit a pull request

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Library not supported"**: Check that the library name matches an entry in `config.json`
- **"No results found"**: The search query might be too specific, or the documentation site might not be indexed well
- **Timeout errors**: Some documentation sites may be slow to respond; this is handled gracefully

### AI Tool Integration Issues

- **Tool not appearing**: Ensure the absolute paths are correct and the Python environment has all dependencies installed
- **Permission errors**: Make sure the Python executable and main.py file have proper permissions
- **Environment variables**: Verify that `SERPER_API_KEY` is correctly set in the MCP configuration, not just your shell environment
- **Virtual environment**: Double-check you're using the correct Python path from your virtual environment

### Debugging

The server includes error handling for:
- Network timeouts
- Invalid library names  
- Empty search results
- Malformed configuration files
